# Cbin CLI

**Cbin CLI** offers a safer alternative to the traditional `rm` command. Instead of permanently deleting files, it moves them to a centralized recycle bin directory, allowing for easy recovery when needed.

## Features

- **Recycle Instead of Delete**: Moves files to a designated recycle bin instead of permanently deleting them.
- **Configurable Settings**: Customize paths and other options through the `config.conf` file.
- **File Restoration**: Restore files from the recycle bin effortlessly.
- **Centralized Node Management**: Add or remove agent nodes seamlessly via the master dashboard.

## Installation

Install Cbin CLI with a single command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/TheDevOpsPlayground/cbin/raw/refs/heads/v1/agent/bin/install.sh | sudo bash
```

### Command Options

- `-rf`, `--force-remove`: Forcefully remove files or directories (use cautiously).
- `-f`, `--files`: Specify a comma-separated list of files to recycle (e.g., `file1.txt,file2.log`).
- `-restore`, `--restore`: Restore files from the recycle bin.
- `-d`, `--date`: Specify a date to restore files from (format: `YYYY-MM-DD`).
- `-s`, `--single-file`: Restore a single file from the recycle bin for a given date.
- `-h`, `--help`: Display the help message.

## Upcoming Features

- **File Monitoring**: Use `fsnotify` to track changes (creation, modification, or deletion) on specified files.
- **Automated Backups**: Automatically back up modified files to a designated directory.

## Uninstallation

Remove Cbin CLI with this command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://github.com/TheDevOpsPlayground/cbin/raw/refs/heads/v1/agent/bin/uninstall.sh | sudo bash
```
